    "prompt": "A documentary-style photograph of a sales rep in a lived-in home office at twilight, seated at a slightly messy desk with personal items, bathed in soft golden hour or violet-tinged window light. The subject is focused, absorbed in their work, with subtle relief on their face. The composition features off-center placement and generous negative space, with environmental context such as a coffee mug and a window showing the evening sky. Editorial realism, shallow depth of field, and natural light create an intimate, authentic mood. No screens, no text, no visible technology displays.",
